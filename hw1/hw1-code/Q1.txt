Error #1:

  File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 12, characters 23-25:
Error: Syntax error

"match n of": I changed it to "match n with" to fix the Synthax error 



Error #2:

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 13, characters 6-8:
Error: Syntax error

I changed both arrows to fit OCaml Synthax.

  | 0 -> 0
  | _ -> 2 + (dble (n - 1))



Error #3:

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 4-5:
Error: Syntax error

I added the vertical lines before 0 and _ to fix the Syntax error

  | 0 -> 1.0
  |_ -> n * (factorial (n - 1))



Error #4:

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 12, characters 21-22:
Error: Unbound value n

bounded n: (Added value "n" after "dble" and before ": int")

"let dble (n : int) = match n with
  | 0 -> 0
  | _ -> 2 + (dble (n - 1))"



Error #5

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 14, characters 14-18:
Error: Unbound value dble

dble was not defined as a recursive function.

"let rec dble (n : int) = match n with
  | 0 -> 0
  | _ -> 2 + (dble (n - 1))"




Error #6

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 13-22:
Error: Unbound value factorial

I changed the method name to "fact" from "factorial"

let rec fact (n : int)  = match n with 
  | 0 -> 1.0
  |_  -> n * (fact (n - 1))




Error #7

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 12-26:
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int

The pattern "0 -> 1" must return an int because the pattern below it is doing integer arithmetic and return value has to be an int "fact : int -> int"

let rec fact (n : int)  = match n with 
  | 0 -> 1
  |_ -> n * (fact (n - 1))
