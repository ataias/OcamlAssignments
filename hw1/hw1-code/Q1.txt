Error #1:

  File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 12, characters 23-25:
Error: Syntax error

"match n of" was changed to "match n with" 



Error #2:

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 13, characters 6-8:
Error: Syntax error

I changed both arrows to fit OCaml Synthax.

  | 0 -> 0
  | _ -> 2 + (dble (n - 1))



Error #3:

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 4-5:
Error: Syntax error

I added the verticle lines before 0 and _

  | 0 -> 1.0
  |_ -> n * (factorial (n - 1))



Error #4:

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 12, characters 21-22:
Error: Unbound value n

bounded n and gave it a type



Error #5

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 14, characters 14-18:
Error: Unbound value dble

dble was not defined as a recursive function

let rec dble (n : int) = match n with
  | 0 -> 0
  | _ -> 2 + (dble (n - 1))




Error #6

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 13-22:
Error: Unbound value factorial

The method is named fact and not factorial

let rec fact (n : int)  = match n with 
  | 0 -> 1.0
  |_ -> n * (fact (n - 1))




Error #7

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 12-26:
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int

It has to pattern match to an interger value because the function was expecting an integer

let rec fact (n : int)  = match n with 
  | 0 -> 1
  |_ -> n * (fact (n - 1))
